Creates add-on listings for Plone.org in a visually appealing
way. Allow highlighting of curated add-ons, simpler/cleaner
descriptions of add-ons, and automated retrieval of data from
pypi.python.org.



Features

- with manually added packages, you can optionally specify just the
  package name and load the rest of the field values from PyPi

- lets you indicate which packages not to display in the listing

- lets you map PyPi classifiers and Python versions to friendlier
  display values

- lets you specify add-on categories that are used to organize the
  display of add-ons

- lets you indicate if an add-on should be highlighted ("curated")

- if an add-on has been marked as curated, you can override the
